With Celemony Melodyne Studio 4 v4.2.3.001-R2R, you can correct and improve the pitch, timing, intonation, vibrato, volume, and expression of any audio source, whether it is vocals, instruments, percussive sounds, noise, or entire mixes[^1^]. You can also modify the melody, harmony, rhythm, structure, and timbre of your audio material, creating new musical possibilities and effects.

## How does Celemony Melodyne Studio 4 v4.2.3.001-R2R work?
 
Celemony Melodyne Studio 4 v4.2.3.001-R2R works by analyzing the audio material and identifying the notes and their musical parameters[^1^]. It then displays them as "blobs" on a grid that represents the pitch and time axes[^1^]. You can then use various tools to edit the blobs directly and modify their pitch, duration, position, amplitude, formant spectrum, and other attributes[^1^].
 
Celemony Melodyne Studio 4 v4.2.3.001-R2R offers you different algorithms for different types of audio material: melodic, polyphonic, percussive, universal[^1^]. The algorithm determines how the audio material will be interpreted and displayed by Melodyne[^1^]. The melodic and polyphonic algorithms give you full access to the notes of vocals and mono- or polyphonic instruments[^1^]. The percussive algorithm offers you a time-sliced display suitable for drum loops, percussion instruments and noise-like material[^1^]. The universal algorithm is ideal for time-stretching or transposing entire mixes or polyphonic instrument tracks without access to individual notes[^1^].
